# Working backwards:

- Keeping with K8s control loop principals while working with different compliance frameworks
- Leverage best of breed container security products that use operator pattern; every security product comes with its own operator e.g., Synopsys, Aqua/Twistlock, falco; managing them from a central location
- Normalizing the findings and plugging them to the container lifecycle & compliance framework 

TODO:
1. Fit SCF in K8s operator architecture; identify additional operators that can be included e.g., Calico
2. Reorganize code as following components
- Frontend
- Controller - compliance based rules, different system config files e.g., neo4j
- Event source - watch K8s API server, Docker runtime, Security Monkey
- Enforcer - for k8s, AWS

# SCF - Secure Cloud Native Fabric 

SCF is like a security orchestrator which involves interweaving processes and technology in the most effective manner to strengthen the security posture of an organization.
The Security-Posture should be applicable to different cloud infrastructure types – OpenStack, Kubernetes, Docker. It would however also have specific policies and audit-rules for specific cloud-types.
The essential elements of a security posture are :

1. **Security Requirements** : These can be Compliance Requirements like CIS, GDPR, PCI-DSS etc.        
2. **Asset Groups / Categories** : These are the different asset-types that you would like to secure, for example a Kubernetes Cluster, OpenStack Nodes etc.    
3. **Security Controls** : The type of Security Controls you would like to impose, for example Network-Security, Runtime / Behavioral Security, Image Vulnerability etc.    
4. **Auditors** : These are auditor-types which will be associated with Security-Controls to check if the Security Control is effective.    

SCF sits alongside the Cloud PaaS and integrates with the Cloud Orchestrator to provide security monitoring and configuration services.
Capabilities enabled by SCF include:
* Security configuration posture tracking of Kubernetes container orchestrator and multi-cloud infrastructure
* Tracking real-time compliance—such as CIS, GDPR—posture impacted by security control configuration
* Application workload behavior posture tracking

## Compliance Real-time Impact on Securit Posture (CRISP) 
* Define security goals and their relationship with security control configurations in different asset    
* Associate different auditors to monitor security control configurations    
* Real-time impact security analysis on compliance and best practices due to changes in security configurations in different security controls in different assets    
* Determine risk score based on asset importance and criticality of changes    

## Secure Container Runtime Management (SCRM) 
* Management of security group policies, perimeter security policies, container runtime and networking security policies of a container cluster        
* Holistic small-unit visibility and workload identity based zero-trust communication model    

## Installation    

#### Installing SCF    
**Prerequisite** SCF currently installs on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

1) Clone the repository   
2) Run the shell script installer.sh from SCF folder 
    `./installer.sh`    
    This will download and install all 3rd party components. It will then create the daemons and run the SCF micro-services.    

#### Installing the SCF Agent
The SCF Agent will run as a daemon-process on your cloud-host (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS).    
**We will be adding a simple CLI script for building the SCF-Agent.**

## Accessing the SCF UI
If all goes well, then the SCF UI will be accessible on `https://<IP-address>/`

**Note** :    
* The initial commit does not support RBAC, you can used the following default credential to login    
    `user-name : scf@aricent.com`        
    `password : scfadmin`       
* This is an initial commit, we will be adding more documentation on how to add a Kubernetes Cluster or AWS Cloud to SCF for monitoring    
* We will be adding the SCF-Agent builder as the next step

## Use cases   

**1) SD-WAN for Telco**   
* SCF can be used to secure SDN applications forming a SD-WAN network   
* SCF Security Postures can be exported from CI/DI environments to a Production Environment   
* SCF can monitor security-alarms and auto-act on them   
* It can audit Security-Configurations and scan vulnerabilities in Registry Images   

**2) Apply and Monitor Security Posture**   
* SCF can be used to secure a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service hosted by a Telco   
* The Telco can provide CDN as a Service, for popular content.   
* Video and data from the Origin-Server are pulled into the CDN Point-of-Presence servers distributed across the Geographies   
* SCF can secure the end-point security policies and also audit the S3-Storage in a Hybrid Cloud environment   

**3) Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)**   
* SCF would require the Kubernetes API server access-account and credentials as a manifest file from the Cloud Orchestrator   
* SCF would require credentials of the private Docker Repository for setting up Image-Scanning   
* An SCF Agent Application, will be installed on the Kubernetes-Master Host, for setting up secure-communications on a distributed high-performance message-bus with the SCF Server-Application.   
* SCF Agent will use CIS Benchmark rules (configurable) Security Audits. It will enforce Network-Policies using the CNI through the Kube-API Gateway.
