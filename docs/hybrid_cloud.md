![Cloud Deployments](./images/cloud_dep.png)

1) SCF-SCRM gives a view of deployments and security setup across multiple Hybrid Clouds   
2) Security Policies can be configured as templates, which are attached as instances to workloads   
3) These templates are part of The Security Controls which are applied when a Security Posture is deployed   
4) If a Security Template gets updated as part of the Security Posture, then it gets pushed towards the policy-instances on the workloads
